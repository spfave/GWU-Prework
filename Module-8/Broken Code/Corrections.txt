The Boo-Boos in Boos Website:

# In 'BooTheDog.html':

1. In the website body top div, "Boo The Dog Fan Page!" was not enclosed in a header1 (<h1>) set of tags and thus css styling was not applied. 

    was: Boo The Dog Fan Page!
    mod: <h1>Boo The Dog Fan Page!</h1>

2. In the 'About Boo' section, paragraphs were not separated using paragraph (<p>) tags. 

    was:
        ... 
    mod: 
        <p>...</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>...</p>

3. In the 'About Boo' section, the anchor (<a>) tag did not include the wikipedia link in the hyperlink (href) attribute.

    was: <a	href="">...</a>
    mod: <a	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boo_(dog)">...</a>

4. The image (<img>) tag to show a picture of Boo the Dog did not have opening and closing tag brackets, '<' and '>' respectively. As a result the image object was not correctly interpreted and rendered as a picture, but instead the HTML source code was rendered as text. 

    was: img class="..." src="..."
    mod: <img class="..." src="...">

5. In the 'List of Boo's Favorite Things' section, the ordered list (<ol>) items were not enclosed in list item (<li>) tags to be rendered as individual list items. As a result the list items were listed in a single row. 

    was:
        <ol>
            Dressing Up
            Eating Grass
            Sleeping
            Swimming
            Hiking
        </ol>
    mod:
        <ol>
            <li>Dressing Up</li>
            <li>Eating Grass</li>
            <li>Sleeping</li>
            <li>Swimming</li>
            <li>Hiking</li>
        </ol>

6. In the 'Boo Rules' text color choice section, the color selection button IDs and button text did not match up. As a result with connection to the logic.js javascript code the button would produce a text color change inconsistent with its label. 

    was:
        <button class="btn" id="textGreen">Orange</button>
        <button class="btn" id="textOrange">Pink</button>
        <button class="btn" id="textPink">Green</button>
    mod: 
        <button class="btn" id="textGreen">Green</button>
        <button class="btn" id="textOrange">Orange</button>
        <button class="btn" id="textPink">Pink</button>

7. The script (<script>) tag included the incorrect javascript source file name ('error.js' instead of 'logic.js') for the source (src) attribute. 

    was: <script ... src="error.js"></script>
    mod: <script ... src="logic.js"></script>


# In 'logic.js':

1. The variable 'booFacts' was an array of a single string. The individual facts were not enclosed in their own pair of double quotes ("") and separated by commas (,) to properly define an array of multiple facts. 

    was: ["Boo is a pomeranian, Boo's best friend is another pomeranian named Buddy, Boo the Pomeranian was born on March 16, making him a Pisces, Boo's favourite food is grass, Boo has released two books"]
    mod: ["Boo is a pomeranian", "Boo's best friend is another pomeranian named Buddy", "Boo the Pomeranian was born on March 16, making him a Pisces", "Boo's favourite food is grass", "Boo has released two books"]

2. For the '#textPink' jquery click event function the css style color change command did not have double quotes ("") around the css color name. 

    was: ....css(..., pink)
    mod: ....css(..., "pink")

3. For the '#boxGrow' and '#boxShrink' jquery click event functions the definition of a click event listener was not enclosed in double quotes (""). 

    was: ....on(click, ...)
    mod: ....on("click", ...)
